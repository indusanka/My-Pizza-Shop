README for pizza1  solution
Thanks to Indus S. for most of the code in this solution.

Please make sure you can run the project on topcat, because
that's where the grader will run it.  See database.php for
code that lets you run on topcat. You need to put your own
username there.

Some students used session variables, but we have not yet 
covered that topic, so read this solution to see how the
room number is passed from request to request in the student
pages via a room parameter.

The student forms have method = GET so we can see the parameters.
